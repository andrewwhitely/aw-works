### Thoughts

While I enjoyed this a ton, I don't know if I'd necessarily agree with all the reviews calling this the best movie ever. The Michaels™ did a great job playing two roles which I feel like a lot of the rave came from (deserved of course).

The music scene transcending generations and cultures was both amazing as a highlight of Black culture but also an excellent foreshadow of what was to come.

I think Coogler & Co did an excellent job in making a vampire movie not an extremely obvious, sterotypical vampire movie. While the scene where Remick runs up to the house with the klansmen and his wife _(sidenote, I would have sworn they said engines at first because of the accent, instead of Indians)_ could be taken as obvious, I don't think it was **really** hammered home for the majority of viewers until Cornbread tried to get back into the juke later that night.

One thing I disliked was that it sort of felt like there was almost too clean of split to when they started fighting the vampires. It felt like there was a movie that was longer and then was cut into thirds, and only the first and last portions made the final edit. Maybe just because the pacing was pretty much over what felt like 12 hours was a little rough for me. But if a director's cut or extended version comes out? I'll absolutely be tuning in.

As for vampires themselves, I didn't hate them. The blood splatter and spraying was a little corny and pulled me out of what was a pretty immersive movie from the beginning. I did really enjoy how the vampires were not portrayed as some superhuman, almighty being that is coming to wreak havoc. Portraying them as a demon spirit, and how the most simple of things can save you (a jar of pickled garlic, wood, random silver objects) that even sharecroppers in 1930s Mississippi could have access to was great.

Growing up I was taught that the devil is not some superhuman being, but rather a person, feeling, item, really anything - that if you let it in, it can take over your life. I think that was a great way to portray the vampires in this movie. They were not some superhuman strength villain like Thanos, but rather a guitar and love for music. This seemingly harmless instrument and passion ended up causing an enternity of longing for the vampires and trauma for Sammie and the survivors. This same pain and experience that took him to become a great blues blues guitarist and singer comes, like Slim said, is not something you can fake, but has to come from the soul.

### Characters & Acting

- Michael B. Jordan did an amazing job at playing Smoke and Stack. How Stack was struggling to roll his cigarette and the end really let us know how tied together they were as twins and the pain that his caused him.
- Hailee Steinfeld put that ⅛th to use most definitely.
- For a debut, Miles did phenomenal, and the fact he learned to play the blues guitar as well in two months shows his dedication. Can't wait to see what else he does.

### Sound & Score

Ludwig Göransson you absolute madman you did a phenomenal job yet again.
